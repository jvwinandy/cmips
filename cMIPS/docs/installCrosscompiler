# to compile GCC, these three libraries may have to be fetched:

wget http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-3.1.5/mpfr-3.1.5.tar.gz
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpc/mpc-1.0.3.tar.gz
wget ftp://ftp.gmplib.org/pub/gmp/gmp-6.1.2.tar.bz2

# it is (very) likely that new(er) versions have been released; please
# fetch the new(est) versions.

# and, according to instructions in 
#   http://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html
# after you downloaded and expanded the GCC sources, expand the three
# tarballs into the directory with GCC sources, change their
# directory names to mpfr mpc gmp (removing the version suffixes);
# then these libraries will be automagically compiled as part of GCC.

# OTOH, if you are very lucky, the libraries installed by aptitude will do...

# fetch all the auxiliary programs -- this assumes a Debian installation
aptitude install make flex bison libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev g++

# clean up any aliases/function replacements for /bin/ls
unset ls

# make sure the installed files are read-exec by all
umask 022

# check the latest version of GCC in http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/
# check the latest version of binutils in http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils

BINUTILS=binutils-2.25
COMPILER=gcc-5.1.0

wget -c http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/${BINUTILS}.tar.bz2
wget -c http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/${COMPILER}/${COMPILER}.tar.gz

# the cross-compiler will be installed in /opt/cross so it does not,
# in any way, conflicts with the native GCC or binutils.

# set the installation pathname as PREFIX so that {bin,lib,man} are put there
#   make sure you have write permission to /opt/cross,
#   else perform the "make install" steps as root (with umask 022)
export PREFIX=/opt/cross/
export TARGET=mips

## build and install binutils (takes a few minutes)

tar -xvjf ${BINUTILS}.tar.bz2
cd ${BINUTILS}
./configure --target=$TARGET --prefix=$PREFIX --disable-nls
make

# do the next one as root?  su ; umask 022 ; make install ; exit

make install
cd ..

## build and install GCC (takes rather more than a few minutes)

tar -xvzf ${COMPILER}.tar.gz
cd ${COMPILER}

# you may want/need to expand the libraries' tarballs at this point,
#  by doing
#  [[ do not copy these commands unless versions are same as shown below ]]
#    tar -xvjf ../gmp-6.1.2.tar.bz2 
#    mv gmp-6.1.2/ gmp
#    tar -xvzf ../mpc-1.0.3.tar.gz
#    mv mpc-1.0.3/ mpc
#    tar -xxvf ../mpfr-3.1.5.tar.xz
#    mv mpfr-3.1.5/ mpfr

export PATH=$PATH:$PREFIX/bin
./configure --target=$TARGET --prefix=$PREFIX --disable-nls \
     --enable-languages=c,c++ --without-headers
make all-gcc

# do the next one as root?  su ; umask 022 ; make install-gcc ; exit
make install-gcc
cd ..


# once GCC and Binutils are compiled and installed, all that is needed is
#  for you to add the new path to your PATH, preferably in your ~/.bashrc
#  do not forget to substitute ${PREFIX} by /opt/cross in ~/.bashrc
export PATH=${PATH}:${PREFIX}/bin
export MANPATH=${MANPATH}:${PREFIX}/man


# and that ends the cross-compiler installation.


# You may also want/need to install GHDL on your machine.  As of July,
#  2015, there is no official Debian package.  You must download the
#  unofficial package from Sourceforge at:
#    https://sourceforge.net/p/ghdl-updates/wiki/Debian%20Instructions/
#  and pick the appropriate version for your computer (32 or 64 bit).
#
# You also need to fetch gnat and libgnat from somewhere; I find it easier
#  to download the .deb files onto the same directory as ghdl*.deb
#
# When doing  dpkg -i ghdl*.deb  it will whine and complain about versions.
#  What I have done is to use the following RISKY command:
#
#  dpkg --ignore-depends=ghdl*.deb --ignore-depends=libgnat-4.6 -i ghdl*.deb
#
#  it forces dpkg to ignore the dependencies for GHDL and install it
#  with whatever version your machine has for gnat/libgnat.  Caveat emptor.
